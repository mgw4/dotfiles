I have decided to switch from a Eclipse with cdt and pydev for my dev work to vim.  I had alwayse seen vim as a tool to modify config files on headless servers. Boy was I wrong!!!!  

A a new power vim user I have decided to share my config files to help others who are unwilling to make the switch to using vim for their dev work.

This set of config files provides all of the major features that I was previously using with Eclipse for python developement, with the exception of the pyunit test launching.

Once you go vim you wont look back.
